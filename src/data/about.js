  background: 'Welcome to my site! I am a front end software developer with a background in environmental sciences.\n\nAfter seven years in the environmental services field, I felt like I needed a new challenge. I love solving puzzles, building projects, and collaborating with others. I tried some front end coding on freeCodeCamp and realized that software development is a perfect fit for me. I attended Turing School of Software & Design in order to immerse myself into programming in a diverse environment that teaches the full suite of developer tools. After completing the front end engineering program, I am ready to learn new skills and technologies.\n\nI am dedicated to lifelong learning, I love helping others, and I am ready to make an impact in the software development field.',
